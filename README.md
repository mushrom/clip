Clip is a clipboard daemon designed to be versatile and flexible, while still being easy to configure and modify, and light weight.
When it's finished, it allow you to have multiple clipboards, share clipboards over the interwebs and between operating systems, and save clipboards to a file for backup. 

At the moment, it's a bit shabby, and is just a bored coding project.
